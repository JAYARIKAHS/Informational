Temperature: This setting controls the randomness of the AI's output. A low temperature makes the AI more predictable, while a high temperature makes it more creative but also more unpredictable. Think of it like seasoning in cooking – too little and it's bland, too much and it's overwhelming.
Tokens: Tokens are the individual units of text or input that the AI processes. Each word or character is considered a token. It's like building blocks for language – the more tokens, the more detailed and complex the output can be.
Weight: Weight assigns importance to different parts of the input or prompts given to the AI. It's like giving priority to certain ingredients in a recipe – the heavier the weight, the more influence that part of the input will have on the AI's response.
Top P: This refers to the probability threshold for generating the next token in the AI's output. It determines how many of the most likely tokens the AI considers when generating text. It's like choosing from a menu – the higher the Top P, the more options the AI considers before making a choice.
Top K: Similar to Top P, Top K controls the number of tokens the AI considers when generating text, but instead of a probability threshold, it sets a hard limit on the number of tokens to consider. It's like setting a maximum number of options to choose from.
Max Tokens: This parameter determines the maximum length of the output text generated by the AI. It's like setting a word limit for an essay – the AI will stop generating text once it reaches the specified maximum number of tokens.
Min Tokens: Conversely, Min Tokens sets the minimum length of the output text. It ensures that the AI generates responses of a certain length, avoiding very short or incomplete outputs.
Beam Search: Beam Search is a search algorithm used during text generation to explore multiple possible sequences of tokens simultaneously. It helps the AI find more diverse and higher-quality outputs by considering different paths through the generation process.
Repetition Penalty: This parameter penalizes the AI for repeating tokens it has already used in the generated text. It encourages the AI to produce more diverse and varied outputs by discouraging repetition.
